//! Test configuration fixtures and resource loading utilities.
//!
//! This module provides shared utilities for loading test fixtures from
//! predefined source directories. It includes:
//! - Constants defining fixture source directories
//! - Helper functions for resolving and copying fixture files/directories
//!
//! These utilities are used by various test fixtures to preload resources
//! like dataset manifests, provider configurations, and dataset snapshots.
//!
//! # Test Resource Preloading
//!
//! This module supports preloading test resources from predefined source directories:
//!
//! ## Dataset Manifests (.json files)
//! **Source directories searched (in order):**
//! - `tests/config/manifests/`
//! - `config/manifests/`
//!
//! Use `resolve_dataset_manifest_source_file()` to find manifest files, or use the
//! `read_manifest_fixture()` function to read manifest content directly.
//!
//! ## Provider Configurations (.toml files)
//! **Source directories searched (in order):**
//! - `tests/config/providers/`
//! - `config/providers/`
//!
//! Use `resolve_provider_config_source_file()` to find provider config files.
//!
//! ## Dataset Snapshot Reference Data (directory trees)
//! **Source directories searched (in order):**
//! - `tests/config/snapshots/`
//! - `config/snapshots/`
//!
//! Use `resolve_snapshot_source_dir()` to find dataset snapshot directories.
//!
//! # Fixture Resolution Process
//!
//! When resolving fixtures, this module uses a search algorithm:
//! 1. **Search in order**: Each source directory is checked sequentially
//! 2. **First match wins**: The first existing file/directory is used
//! 3. **Canonicalization**: Paths are resolved to absolute, canonical paths
//! 4. **Type verification**: Files must exist as files, directories as directories
//! 5. **Error on missing**: If no match is found, `None` is returned
//!
//! This allows tests to work with different project layouts while maintaining
//! consistent resource loading behavior.

//! Test environment directory management.
//!
//! This module provides low-level temporary directory management for isolated test environments.
//! It handles the creation of temporary directories with test-specific naming and automatic cleanup.
//!
//! # Core Functionality
//!
//! ## Directory Management
//! - Creates temporary directories with test-specific naming
//! - Handles automatic cleanup with optional debug retention
//!
//! ## Integration Points
//!
//! This module is primarily used by:
//! - [`super::ctx::TestCtxBuilder`] - High-level test environment construction
//!
//! Most test authors should use the [`super::ctx`] module's [`TestCtxBuilder`](super::ctx::TestCtxBuilder) rather
//! than working directly with [`TestEnvDir`], as it provides a more convenient API.

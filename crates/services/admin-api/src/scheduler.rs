//! Scheduler trait abstractions for job and worker management
//!
//! This module defines the `SchedulerJobs` and `SchedulerWorkers` traits, which provide
//! abstraction layers for scheduling/managing dataset extraction jobs and querying worker
//! information. The traits are implemented by the controller service, following the
//! dependency inversion principle.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! - **admin-api**: Defines the `SchedulerJobs` and `SchedulerWorkers` traits (abstractions)
//! - **controller**: Provides `Scheduler` (implementation)
//! - **handlers**: Depend on the traits via `Arc<dyn SchedulerJobs>` and `Arc<dyn SchedulerWorkers>`
//!
//! ## Responsibilities
//!
//! ### SchedulerJobs
//! - Job lifecycle management (schedule, stop, query, delete)
//! - Worker coordination and selection
//! - Job state validation and transitions
//! - Bulk cleanup operations for terminal jobs
//!
//! ### SchedulerWorkers
//! - Worker information queries
//! - Worker status retrieval

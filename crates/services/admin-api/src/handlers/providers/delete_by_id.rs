/// Handler for the `DELETE /providers/{name}` endpoint
///
/// Deletes a specific provider configuration by its name from the dataset store.
///
/// This operation is idempotent - deleting a non-existent provider returns success.
///
/// ## Path Parameters
/// - `name`: The unique name/identifier of the provider to delete
///
/// ## Response
/// - **204 No Content**: Provider successfully deleted (or did not exist)
/// - **400 Bad Request**: Invalid provider name format
/// - **500 Internal Server Error**: Store error occurred during deletion
///
/// ## Error Codes
/// - `INVALID_PROVIDER_NAME`: The provided name is invalid or malformed
/// - `STORE_ERROR`: Failed to delete provider configuration from store
///
/// This handler:
/// - Validates and extracts the provider name from the URL path
/// - Attempts to delete the provider configuration from both store and cache
/// - Returns 204 even if the provider does not exist (idempotent behavior)
///
/// ## Safety Notes
/// - Deletion removes both the configuration file from storage and the cached entry
/// - Once deleted, the provider configuration cannot be recovered
/// - Any datasets using this provider may fail until a new provider is configured

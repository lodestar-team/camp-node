/// Retrieves and returns a specific worker by its node ID from the scheduler.

/// ## Path Parameters
/// - `id`: The unique node identifier of the worker to retrieve
///
/// ## Response
/// - **200 OK**: Returns the worker information as JSON with detailed metadata
/// - **400 Bad Request**: Invalid node ID format (not parseable as NodeId)
/// - **404 Not Found**: Worker with the given node ID does not exist
/// - **500 Internal Server Error**: Scheduler query error
///
/// ## Error Codes
/// - `INVALID_WORKER_ID`: The provided ID is not a valid worker node identifier
/// - `WORKER_NOT_FOUND`: No worker exists with the given node ID
/// - `SCHEDULER_GET_WORKER_ERROR`: Failed to retrieve worker from scheduler

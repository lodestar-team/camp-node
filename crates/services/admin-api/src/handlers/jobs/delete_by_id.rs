/// Handler for the `DELETE /jobs/{id}` endpoint
///
/// Deletes a job by its ID if it's in a terminal state (Completed, Stopped, or Failed).
/// This is a safe, idempotent operation that only removes finalized jobs from the system.
///
/// ## Path Parameters
/// - `id`: The unique identifier of the job to delete (must be a valid JobId)
///
/// ## Response
/// - **204 No Content**: Job was successfully deleted or does not exist (idempotent)
/// - **400 Bad Request**: Invalid job ID format (not parseable as JobId)
/// - **409 Conflict**: Job exists but is not in a terminal state (cannot be deleted)
/// - **500 Internal Server Error**: Database error occurred
///
/// ## Error Codes
/// - `INVALID_JOB_ID`: The provided ID is not a valid job identifier
/// - `JOB_CONFLICT`: Job exists but is not in a terminal state
/// - `GET_JOB_ERROR`: Failed to retrieve job from scheduler (database error)
/// - `DELETE_JOB_ERROR`: Failed to delete job from scheduler (database error)
///
/// ## Idempotent Behavior
/// This handler is idempotent - deleting a non-existent job returns 204 (success).
/// This allows clients to safely retry deletions without worrying about 404 errors.
///
/// ## Behavior
/// This handler provides safe job deletion with the following characteristics:
/// - Only jobs in terminal states (Completed, Stopped, Failed) can be deleted
/// - Non-terminal jobs are protected from accidental deletion
/// - Non-existent jobs return success (idempotent behavior)
/// - Database layer ensures atomic deletion
///
/// ## Terminal States
/// Jobs can only be deleted when in these states:
/// - Completed → Safe to delete
/// - Stopped → Safe to delete  
/// - Failed → Safe to delete
///
/// Protected states (cannot be deleted):
/// - Scheduled → Job is waiting to run
/// - Running → Job is actively executing
/// - StopRequested → Job is being stopped
/// - Stopping → Job is in process of stopping
/// - Unknown → Invalid state
